# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for 1D Diffusion Equation

## Overview
This repository implements a **Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)** to solve the **1D Diffusion Equation** using PyTorch. PINNs use deep learning to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), enforcing both boundary conditions and the governing equation during training.

This code:
- Solves the **1D Diffusion Equation** using a physics-informed neural network.
- Implements **automatic differentiation** to compute PDE residuals.
- Uses **boundary and initial conditions** for supervised learning.
- Supports **Adam and L-BFGS optimizers** for training.
- Provides **visualizations of the learned solution** against the exact solution.
